    <p>1. Player is presented with 4 buttons.</p>
    <p>2. Each button is filled with different colours(green,red,yellow and blue).</p>
    <p>3. Each colour is associated with different sounds.</p>
    <p>4. When player clicks on any key the game starts, a random button will toggle.</p>
    <p>5. The player has to click on the toggled button and wait for 1 sec to get the next random button to toggle.</p>
    <p>6. This time the player has to click 2 buttons - the previous button and the new button and again wait for the next button sequence.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Example: Player gets Red as his first button in the sequence he clicks on Red button and waits for 1 second,
        lets assume he gets Blue as his 2nd random button,now the player has 
        to click both Red and Blue buttons in the same sequential order they were prompted. 3rd time user gets Yellow then the player has to click Red,
         Blue and Yellow in the same sequential order they were prompted and continue to do so until they click the wrong sequential order
          at which point the the game will be over and the user has to start from begining i.e Level 1.
